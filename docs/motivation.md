I have used some of my expertise to configure and assemble these simulations using ROS 2 Jazzy and Ubuntu 24.04, as this is a major barrier for most professionals, students, and professors who have crossed paths with me. It requires expertise and a deep understanding of operating systems, simulation architectures, transformation trees, event-based architectures, coding, algebra, networking, and many other fields that are uncommon for one person to master. Therefore, this project is intended for anyone interested in working with mobile robotics, specifically in multi-robot settings, who doesn't have the time or budget to assemble this base themselves. Below, I share some experiences and explain why I decided to opt for the Open Source initiative.

## [Letter to the Community](#letter-to-the-community-link)

Before you read this letter, I would like to clarify that I’m truly tired of the academic and private sectors, as well as people who have little to offer but prefer competing against others instead of collaborating and nurturing. From my experiences, I’ve realized that both academia and the private sector are not very healthy environments, mainly because people often pursue their own agendas and compete against others rather than collaborating and nurturing. This behavior is something I have engaged in myself when I was younger.

I believe this is mostly true because people may feel a little bit better knowing that their place in the world could be guaranteed over someone else’s with a better research, a better product, a better laboratory, a better student, a better department, a better software, and so on. In the academia, for example, some laboratories do not share ongoing research or state-of-the-art methods but rather peripheral works, which is something people often discuss in meetings. Another significant problem that anyone with a basic intellect can realize is the peer-review system, but I will let you think about that on your own. For obvious reasons, a private company would never do such a thing neighter.

The statement I pose here seem a bit radical, however, I would like to clarify that these views are not entirely mine, and I could support them with examples. I believe that this treacherous environment could be inherent to human nature, just like the need to eat, breathe, and drink water, and is exacerbated by the lack of funding, lack of appreciation for one’s expertise and experiences, people constantly trying to steal expertise for personal gain of any sort, lack of honesty and sincerity, and lack of intellectual maturity, which amplify selfish behaviors that are harmful to society.

Furthermore, to avoid letting this statement be thrown out without further discussion, one should note that interests must be satisfied for this world to work. This is an argument you can extrapolate on if you wish, and it implies that people are inclined to further their agendas by stepping over others without facing consequences. Consequently, as someone from an emerging country in a very competitive environment with a nonexistent budget and a wage that is disproportionate to my efforts and expertise, I feel simply tired in this environment.

Finally, if you have the intention to reach me with any stupid and selfish discussion regarding your beautiful life and relevant experiences or business, here is a compreensive list of my former bosses or people who I have had the pleasure to work with in these last 15 years and that provided me with a nurturing environment with meaninful discussions about science and other matters.
