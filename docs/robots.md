# Available Robots

This package is ready to work with 2 different UGV and 1 type of UAV in Gazebo Ignition. All robots were adapted to work properly within the simulations provided, this is due to the fact that the way they are published in Fuel might not be appropriate for out-of-the-box use, given that Gazebo Ignition and Rviz see the models and topics in a different way.
